### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub

Hello, I'm Bui Ngoc Huy. I graduated from the University of Greenwich-Vietnam and currently work as a Software Developer at Kaopiz Co. The architecture of web applications interests me, and I'm focused on improving my back-end skills using programming languages such as C#, Java, PHP, and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy my profile. Best wishes!
