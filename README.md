### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub 


Welcome, I'm Bui Ngoc Huy. I'm a senior at the University of Greenwich-Vietnam. I work as a back-end DotNet developer. The architecture of web applications interests me. I'm focusing on improving my.NET and ReactJS skills. I hope you enjoy my profile. Thank you for reading. Best wishes!
